# Zenova Admin Panel — Backend Implementation Plan

> **Platform**: Zenova — an AI-powered wellness & lifestyle tracking app  
> **Stack**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) + Redis + OpenRouter AI  
> **Auth**: JWT (RS256) with Role-based access (Super Administrator, Administrator, Moderator, User)

---

## What is Zenova?

Zenova is a **comprehensive health & wellness tracking platform** that lets users:
- Track **meals, workouts, meditation, yoga, sleep, mood, steps, screen time, reading, habits, medicines, menstrual cycles, and BMR**
- Chat with 3 AI bots: **Calia** (Lifestyle Coach), **Noura** (Nutritionist), **Aeron** (Personal Trainer)
- Earn **NovaCoins** and **Medals** through a gamification system with ranks, levels, streaks, and quests
- Receive **push notifications** via Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Get AI-generated **meal plans** and **wellness recommendations** via OpenRouter

## Existing Infrastructure We Leverage

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Role model (`Super Administrator`, `Administrator`, `Moderator`, `instructor`, `User`) | ✅ Exists |
| Permission model (controller + action RBAC) | ✅ Exists |
| JWT auth middleware (`authenticate.js`) | ✅ Exists |
| User model with `roles` field (ObjectId array → roles collection) | ✅ Exists |
| Paginate plugin on Role model | ✅ Exists |
| All 15+ tracking log models with `userId` + `timestamps` | ✅ Exists |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No admin routes, controllers, or services exist yet.** We are building the entire admin layer from scratch.

## Category 1: 🟢 BASIC (Core Admin Panel — Build First)

These are the essential routes that every admin panel needs. They provide **user oversight, platform analytics, and management capabilities**.

---

### 1.1 Dashboard Analytics

High-level KPIs for the admin dashboard home screen.

| # | Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/api/admin/dashboard/overview` | GET | Total users, new users today/this week/this month, active users (logged in last 7 days), total NovaCoins in circulation |
| 2 | `/api/admin/dashboard/user-growth` | GET | User registration trend — daily/weekly/monthly counts with `?period=7d|30d|90d|1y` |
| 3 | `/api/admin/dashboard/activity-summary` | GET | Total logs across all categories (meals, workouts, sleep, etc.) for a given date range |
| 4 | `/api/admin/dashboard/top-features` | GET | Most-used tracking features ranked by log count (e.g., meal > workout > mood) |

**MongoDB Pattern** (example for user-growth):
```js
// Aggregation: Users grouped by registration date
User.aggregate([
  { $match: { createdAt: { $gte: startDate } } },
  { $group: {
    _id: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$createdAt" } },
    count: { $sum: 1 }
  }},
  { $sort: { _id: 1 } }
]);
```

}
```

---

## Category 3: 🔵 FUTURE (Advanced Features — Build Later)

These are the features you specifically mentioned about **caching external API data** (food/nutrition lookups) so we don't have to call the API repeatedly.

---

### 3.1 Food & Nutrition Data Cache

> **The Concept**: When a user searches for a food item (e.g., "kitchen food" or "chicken biryani"), the app calls an external API (like Nutritionix, Edamam, or the OpenRouter Imagine API) to get nutritional values. Instead of calling the API every time, we **cache the result in MongoDB** so future lookups are instant and free.

| # | Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 47 | `/api/admin/food-cache` | GET | List all cached food items (paginated, searchable) |
| 48 | `/api/admin/food-cache` | POST | Manually add a food item with its nutritional values |
| 49 | `/api/admin/food-cache/:id` | PATCH | Edit cached nutritional values (admin correction) |
| 50 | `/api/admin/food-cache/:id` | DELETE | Remove a cached food entry |
| 51 | `/api/admin/food-cache/stats` | GET | Cache hit rate, total cached items, most searched items |
| 52 | `/api/admin/food-cache/bulk-import` | POST | Bulk import food data from CSV/JSON |

**New Model — `foodCacheModel.js`:**
```js
{
  name: String,                    // "Chicken Biryani", "Paneer Tikka"
  nameNormalized: String,          // lowercase, trimmed for fast lookup
  category: String,                // "Indian", "Italian", "Snack", etc.
  calories: Number,
  protein: Number,
  carbs: Number,
  fats: Number,
  fiber: Number,
  servingSize: String,             // "1 plate", "100g", "1 cup"
  source: String,                  // "nutritionix", "openrouter", "admin_manual"
  imageUrl: String,                // cached image if from Imagine API
  metadata: Object,                // raw API response for reference
  searchCount: Number,             // how many times this was looked up (popularity)
  isVerified: Boolean,             // admin-verified = true
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**How caching works (flow):**
```
User searches "Chicken Biryani"
       │
       ▼
  Check foodCache collection
       │
  ┌────┴────┐
  │ Found?  │
  ├── YES ──┤──→ Return cached data (FREE, instant)
  │         │    Increment searchCount
  └── NO ───┘
       │
       ▼
  Call External API (Nutritionix / OpenRouter)
       │
       ▼
  Save response → foodCache collection
       │
       ▼
  Return data to user
```

| 54 | `/api/admin/ai-cache/:id` | DELETE | Invalidate specific cached responses |

## Authorization Middleware Design

```js
// src/middlewares/authorize.js
// Usage: router.get('/admin/users', authenticate(), authorize('Super Administrator', 'Administrator'), handler)

const authorize = (...allowedRoles) => async (req, res, next) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.user.id).populate('roles', 'name');
  const userRoles = user.roles.map(r => r.name);
  const hasAccess = allowedRoles.some(role => userRoles.includes(role));
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      success: false,
      data: {},
      message: 'Forbidden — insufficient permissions'
    });
  }
  next();
};
```

---

## Route Registration

```js
// In src/routes/index.js — add:
import adminRoutes from './adminRoutes';
router.use('/admin', adminRoutes);
// All admin routes will be under: /api/admin/*
```

---

## Delivery Phases

| Phase | Category | Routes | Estimated Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | 🟢 Basic | #1 – #25 | Core priority |
| **Phase 2** | 🟡 Extra | #26 – #46 | Secondary priority |
| **Phase 3** | 🔵 Future | #47 – #57 | When external API integration is ready |

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Test each admin route via Postman/REST client
- Verify authorization — regular `User` role gets 403 on all admin routes
- Test pagination, search, and filtering on `/admin/users`
- Verify aggregation queries return correct counts against known test data

### Manual Verification
- Seed test users and verify dashboard numbers match
- Test ban/unban flow end-to-end
- Verify audit logs record every admin action
- Test notification broadcast reaches target users

---

## Open Questions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **1. Soft-delete vs Hard-delete for users?**  
> Should deleting a user permanently remove their data, or just mark them as `isDeleted: true` and hide from active queries? Soft-delete is recommended for data retention.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **2. Which external API for food nutrition data?**  
> For the Future category food caching, which API will be used? Options: Nutritionix, Edamam, CalorieNinja, or OpenRouter-based custom lookup. This affects the `foodCacheModel` schema.

> [!NOTE]
> **3. Admin panel access level split?**  
> Currently, the existing roles are: `Super Administrator` (full access), `Administrator` (user management), `Moderator` (read-only user management). Should we keep this hierarchy or modify it for admin panel access?
